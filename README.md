## Hey, I’m Kevin 👋

I’m a Software Engineer working at the intersection of **AI engineering, agentic systems, and real-world product delivery**.

- Software Engineer @ Capillary Technologies (AI / Agentic Workflows)
- IIT Gandhinagar (B.Tech, Dual Minors in CSE & AI)
- Building production-grade GenAI systems — not just demos
- Strong believer in learning by building, breaking, and iterating

I enjoy designing **LLM-powered systems**, abstractions over complex workflows, and tooling that makes AI usable at scale.
